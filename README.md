## Project
Built a stories website, designed to host a finite number of stories. A story is a sequence of story blocks that a user can iterate through using arrow controls, or can view a slide show where blocks are iterated by a timer with variable time setting. Each story block is a container for an image or image montage and text. The image sizes should be adjustable in manual sequencing mode.
