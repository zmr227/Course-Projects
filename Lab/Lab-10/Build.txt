=================================================================
 *
 * This project builds an Asp.Net Core Mvc application that:
 * - Defines a set of courses, and a set of lectures for each course.
 *   That generates a one-to-many relationship in the Database.
 * - Uses Entity Framework to manage all data access.
 * - Uses Authentication (but does not have any roles yet).
 * - Uses Session to save a table key across two AddLecture Views.
 * - Shows how to extract a record from a Course table, along with
 *   data it refers to in another Lecture table.
 * - Shows how View structure is determined by the data structure
 *   as well as the application.
 *   
 * This is a demo for class, so the error handling is fairly sparse.

If you have just downloaded this solution from the College Directory:

1. The zip file does not contain a database, so you will have to rebuild it.
   First, unzip and build the project, but don't run it yet.
2. Delete all content from the Migrations folder.
3. Select top menu Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.
4. At the Console prompt, PM>, type add-migration [Initial] where [...] is the name of the migration
5. At the Console prompt type update-database

Now you will be able to run the project and add content.
