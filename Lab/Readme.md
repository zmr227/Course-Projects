### Lab2 - Static Web Pages
- Create three HTML5 Pages: Home, Sitemap, Labs using new features of HTML5.
- Create Javascript page with code to apply theme(light/dark) to a page and design corresponding CSS style sheet.
- Provide links on each page to jump to the others.
- Add three check boxes for lightTheme, darkTheme and pageTheme:
  - The first two will be used to change the theme, ignoring the divs with theme classes. So all pages will have the same theme. 
  - The third checkbox supports reverting to page themes. Save the state of the buttons in local storage, and retrieve from local storage on page load.
